# Library-Assistant-Chatbot

## 📖 Project Description
The Library Assistant Chatbot is a lightweight, rule-based chatbot designed to help library users quickly find books, authors, subjects, and borrowing information.  
It compresses library catalogs and borrowing policies into an interactive chat interface, reducing manual effort and improving accessibility for patrons.

The chatbot provides instant responses without relying on heavy backend systems, making it cost-effective and easy to deploy.


## 🎯 Features
- 📚 Browse books by subject and category  
- ✍️ Search books by author name  
- ✅ Check book availability (number of copies)  
- 🔁 View borrowing and return rules  
- 💡 Quick suggestion buttons for easy interaction  
- 💬 Simple chat-style interface for user queries  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **HTML & CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Git & GitHub**


## 🧠 How It Works
- The chatbot uses predefined library data stored in the backend.
- User queries are matched with keywords such as *books*, *authors*, *availability*, or *borrow rules*.
- Based on the query, relevant information is displayed instantly.
- Suggestion buttons above the input box guide users to common queries.


## 💡 Creative / Unique Feature
- **Suggestion Buttons** above the chat input that allow users to explore books, authors, availability, and borrowing rules without typing.
- Structured responses that organize information clearly instead of long paragraphs.


## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integration with an AI API for natural language understanding.
- Smarter query handling for free-text questions.
- User login system for personalized book recommendations.
- Admin panel for dynamic book and inventory management.
